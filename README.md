## Overview

The Order Management System is a RESTful API service that allows clients to create and retrieve orders. It uses a layered architecture for clear separation of concerns and integrates with:

- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence
- **Redis** for caching
- **Kafka** for event streaming
- **Docker Compose** for local multi-container development
- **Kubernetes (Minikube)** for orchestration and deployment
- **Swagger** for API documentation

---

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Create and retrieve orders.
- **Database Integration:** Uses PostgreSQL for reliable data storage.
- **Caching:** Redis to cache frequently accessed data.
- **Event Streaming:** Kafka to publish order events asynchronously.
- **Containerization:** Docker Compose for local development and testing.
- **Kubernetes Deployment:** Manifests provided for deploying on Minikube.
- **API Documentation:** Automatically generated Swagger docs.
- **Automated CI/CD:** Makefile for building, testing, and deploying.

---

## Architecture

The application follows a clean, layered architecture:

- **API Layer (Handlers):** Manages HTTP requests and routes.
- **Service Layer:** Contains business logic.
- **Repository Layer:** Handles data persistence with PostgreSQL.
- **Cache Layer:** Integrates with Redis for caching.
- **Event Streaming:** Uses Kafka to send order events.
- **Configuration:** Uses a centralized YAML configuration file.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go** (version 1.20+ recommended)
- **Docker** (with Buildx enabled for multi-architecture builds)
- **Minikube** (for local Kubernetes deployment)
- **kubectl** (Kubernetes command-line tool)
- **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and **Kafka** (via Docker images)
- **Swagger CLI** (for generating API documentation)

---

## Setup and Installation

### Local Development with Docker Compose

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/order-management.git
   cd order-management
   ```

2. **Configure the Application:**

   Edit `config/config.yaml` to set your PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kafka connection details.

3. **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command builds the Docker images for the application and supporting services. Your application should be accessible (typically on port 8080).

4. **Test the Application:**

   You can use cURL or your browser to test endpoints (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/health`).

---

### Kubernetes Deployment with Minikube

1. **Start Minikube:**

   ```bash
   make minikube-start
   ```

2. **Deploy the Application:**

   Deploy application, Redis, PostgreSQL, and Ingress manifests using:
   ```bash
   make deploy-minikube
   ```

3. **Open Minikube Tunnel:**

   If using a LoadBalancer or exposing services, run:
   ```bash
   sudo make minikube-tunnel
   ```

4. **Access the Application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://order.local
   ```

---

   The Swagger UI is available at:

   ```
   http://order.local/swagger/index.html
   ```

## Running Tests

- **Unit Tests:**

  Run the tests from the root directory:

  ```bash
  go test ./internal/... -v
  ```

- **Integration Tests:**

  Integration tests can be run using Docker Compose or Minikube to spin up the environment, then executing the tests against that environment.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Service Endpoints Not Found:**
    - Verify that your Deploymentâ€™s pod template has the label `app: order-management`.
    - Check endpoints with:
      ```bash
      kubectl get endpoints order-management
      ```

- **Ingress Not Routing Traffic:**
    - Confirm that your Ingress has an ADDRESS by running:
      ```bash
      kubectl get ingress order-management-ingress
      ```
    - Ensure your `/etc/hosts` file maps `order.local` to your Minikube IP.

- **Pod Readiness Issues:**
    - Inspect your pods:
      ```bash
      kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
      ```
    - Verify that readiness probes are passing.

- **Logs and Events:**
    - Check Ingress controller logs for errors:
      ```bash
      kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx
      ```
